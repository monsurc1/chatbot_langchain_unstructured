The Main Team arrived in Islamabad on 4 June 2022 and, following a period in Skardu, arrived at Askole (Figure 1.3.1) via road on 9 June 2022. They then trekked approximately 70km east to Broad Peak Base Camp (Figure 1.3.4), arriving on 15 June 2022. They conducted acclimatisation, consolidation training, and prepositioned food and equipment at camps higher up the mountain until 10 July 2022. During this period, the Development Team arrived in Islamabad on 9 July 2022. Whilst at Broad Peak Base Camp (4850m) there were five days of snowfall, from 11 July 2022 to 15 July 2022. This prevented the Main Team from leaving the camp. During this period, the Development Team arrived at Askole via road on 14 July 2022.\\n\\nWitness 01 Exhibit 02 Exhibit 13 Exhibit 16\\n\\n5 Source: BSME20 team member.\\n\\n1.3 - Page 4 of 22\\n\\nGFFIGIAL—SENSITIVE\\n\\nDSA/DG/S1/04/22/BSME20\\n\\nDSA/DG/S1/04/22/13SME20\\n\\n© Crown Copyright 2023\\n\\nOFFIGIAL—SENSHIVE\\n\\n1.3.10. Broad Peak Base Camp to Camp 3. On 16 July 2022, the conditions were considered suitable, by the expedition leader (EL), to conduct a summit attempt. Two summit teams were formed: Summit Team 1, comprising of six climbers and Summit Team 2 of four climbers. Summit Team 1 consisted of the EL, Team members 1 to 4 (MT-1 to 4) and Wg Cdr Henderson. Summit Team 2 consisted of Main Team members 5 to 8 (MT-5 to 8). Summit Team 1 commenced their departure from Broad Peak Base Camp (4850m) at approximately 22:00 on 16 July 2022 and arrived at Camp 2 (6250m) at approximately 08:00 on 17 July 2022 (Figure 1.3.4). They spent the day resting, rehydrating, and eating. Summit Team 2 departed Broad Peak Base Camp at approximately 22:00 on 17 July 2022 and were supported to Camp 1 (5500m) by Main Team member 9 (MT- 9) and Main Team member 10 (MT-10).6 Main Team member 11 (MT-11) remained at Broad Peak Base Camp as a central point of contact for communication with the two summit teams.' Summit Team 1 set off from Camp 2 for Camp 3 (7050m) at approximately 05:30 on 18 July 2022 (Figure 1.3.4) and arrived at approximately 10:00. They rested and prepared for a summit attempt that night. Summit Team 2 arrived at Camp 2 by 12:45 on 18 July 2022.\\n\\nWitness 01 Witness 02 Witness 03 Witness 04 Witness 05 Witness 08 Witness 09 Witness 10 Witness 12 Witness 13 Witness 14 Witness 15 Exhibit 16\\n\\nRocky Summit  8035m   Col  7800m   Broad Peak  Summit  8047m   Camp 3  7050m   •   Camp 2  625Orri   %-  Camp 1  5500m   Broad Peak  Base Camp  4850m   •  \\n\\nFigure 1.3.4 — Illustration of route to Broad Peak Summit.8\\n\\n6 MT-9 and MT-10 had not been beyond Camp 2 due to poor acclimatisation.

The terms mentioned, such as \"Extremely Unlikely,\" \"Extremely Likely,\" and \"About as likely as not,\" suggest that the image is depicting a framework for assessing confidence in outcomes or events based on their likelihood of occurrence.
